# A Simple Quiz App


## Description

After doing a few GES exams (As per UI student wey I be), I was curious to build a CBT like application, then I went and did some research and proceeded to implement it on the frontend only.

## Lessons Learned
- Console.log is an heavenly gift
- Logic, (How to visualize and step through the workflow of an app)
- Testing, can't believe I intentionally tried to break the app multiple times


## Design inspiration
I saw the design on Behance and I loved it, big shout out to the designer [Kachino](https://kachino234.github.io/quizie/)
